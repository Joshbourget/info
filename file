About Us
How we got our start, our company mission, our philosophy & our culture.

What Do We Do?

Our team combines specialized skills, knowledge, and professionalism to deliver unique solutions that exceed expectations. Our goal is to create the best looking, easiest to manage, and most budget-friendly websites and applications on the internet.

We have built custom websites and applications for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, Lawton and Cates, Sumter United Ministries, and many more.

When we are asked what we do, we reply, “What do you need done?”

Our technology initiatives revolve around what matters most to you and your business. Our highly experienced and dedicated team members work with you to identify and prioritize your needs and to develop a targeted solution specifically tailored to you. 

The Wildcard target logo represents our overarching goal to target the BEST solutions for our customers with superior, security-centric, cutting-edge, technology. 

black & red target logo
Our logo was built around the idea of solutions.
Wildcard "targets a solution."
~Talin Senner, CEO

Beginnings...
Wildcard was founded in 2007, with the goal of providing more customer-oriented technology services that were customizable, secure, and developed with the future in mind.  At Wildcard we take our mission seriously, working to provide organizations with the most superior, security-centric, IT solutions. We take pride in our work and are committed to developing high quality solutions, tailored to our customer's specific needs, budget, and long term goals. 

Wildcard Corp. has grown exponentially over the years as both an employer and service provider. Headquartered in Stevens Point Wisconsin, we currently employ around 30-40 people and are particularly proud of the fact that we do not subcontract people resources. We employ a variety of experts, all in-house, allowing us to offer a complete range of services customizable to your organization's needs. Our growth is, in part, a result of our company's drive to stay on top of the most current technology trends and industry needs while also maintaining a level of flexibility that has allowed us to cater to many different industries. 

Wildcard Corp. offers a wide variety of technology services and provides specialized support for a diverse range of industries including (but not limited to) Municipalities, Educational Institutions, Medical & Healthcare providers, Law Firms, Manufacturing & Infrastructure, Construction, Agriculture, State & Federal Government Departments, Golf Courses & Property Management, Restaurants, Nonprofits, and more.

What makes Wildcard different? 
Wildcard is not like other technology companies who sell standardized software packages that are "good enough" but not exactly what you're looking for and which are limited by licensing agreements and periodic maintenance that ends up trapping you in a continuous payment cycle.Open Source Initiative logo

Wildcard uses open source software. “Open source” is an umbrella term for software, services, and products that are free to use, inspect, modify, and redistribute.

Open source software is easily customizable and frees organizations from having to make indefinite commitments to specific software vendors. That’s because open source software gives anyone (including you or your employees) the ability to update content, apply bug fixes, and provide any maintenance services the software needs over time. While a vendor can help you select, set up, and maintain an open-source software package, you can always shop around for another qualified vendor, or you can learn to provide your own software maintenance.

Learn more about the benefits of Open Source Software.

The Open Source Initiative
Wildcard is deeply embedded in and committed to open source. We have an open-source software solution for everything. We believe you shouldn’t have to choose between usability, security or cost. That's why we created CastleCMS, GovSurvey, Crowdspire, and Compliance Dashboard - open source software that can cover all of your web development, surveying, crowdfunding, and security needs.

CastleCMS, is an open source, custom web development program, which pairs extreme reliability with such high security that large government entities use it to host their websites.

Crowdspire is an innovative crowdfunding platform for individuals and nonprofits created with the mission to provide the lowest fees in the industry so more funds actually go to the causes you care about.

Company Culture & Community Involvement
Here at Wildcard Corp. we promote a workplace culture in which all members of our team are respected and valued. Part of what we pride ourselves on is our ability to work collaboratively as a team of experts at all rungs of the corporate ladder. From our Chief Executive Officer to the newest intern, we recognize that every Wildcard employee is a valuable member of the team and has something to contribute.

Government
We understand the importance of security to safeguard confidential data when it comes to high-profile technology systems.
At Wildcard, we work with government agencies, as well as state, county, and city administrations to keep technology systems secure through cybersecurity monitoring and assessments. We practice and maintain compliance for your industry’s standards. Additionally, our IT solutions include prompt response, guidance, and resolution by proactively monitoring your systems to give you peace of mind.

Furthermore, we provide the best website solution by developing your website from the ground up. The difference is that we begin by assessing your needs and goals as opposed to deploying a one-size-fits-all website. Our managed hosting and support services allow us to assist you with your website needs every step of the way.

Federal Bureau of Investigation
The FBI.gov website is the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s primary asset for communicating with the national and international public. Architected and managed by Wildcard Corp., the website handles traffic on the order of 16 million hits daily (5.8 billion hits annually) and integrates with a custom Wildcard-developed email delivery system that sends over 1 million emails a day.

Government client- FBI

Wildcard's sophisticated and robust content management system CastleCMS provides a unique combination of world-class content management features and maximum security. Built from the open source content management system, Plone, CastleCMS is an enterprise-scale platform that will offer you and your users flexibility, quality assurance, and a greater user experience.

National Domestic Communications Assistance Center
Government Client- NDCAC

The National Domestic Communications Assistance Center (NDCAC) is a National center, organized under the Department of Justice, and is dedicated to supporting the law enforcement community by acting as a resource center for sharing industry-developed technical solutions. Wildcard Corp. upgraded the previous NDCAC website to our secure content management system, CastleCMS. We were given the design elements, coded the theme to their specifications, and migrated the content.
